# Python

Ubuntu image with pyenv and Python.
Current Python version is 3.10 but you can get any you want by setting another ENV var 'PYTHON_VERSION'


## Usage

Created to save time on getting fresh Python version for other image in multistaged builds, but you can use it as Ubuntu environment with Python3.10 onboard.
